# Each raw dataset should be responsible for a couple of things:
# 1. Whether there are new special token need to be added.
# 2. We should be able to access the train, test, and validation, as well as other split for different use case.
# 3. We should be able to modify the way how instance are created, think prompting.

# Each dataset contains one or more domain, and it can create one or more target task/dataset.
# in universal sense so that we can also fine tune them together.
# Each domain has many skills and slots, skills shares these slots. So that at DU level these
# can be defined once and used many times. (Entities are reused at the type level, and slot can be
# reused by implement frames, so it is platform level reuse).
